# GTA San Andreas - Storyline Enhancement Mod (SEM)
Best summed up as 'Things To Do In San Andreas: Lite Edition'; it ports over all of the mission changes and enhancements from that mod without the extra clutter in it as well as fixing errors that weren't addressed. It also adds some overworld tweaks to make the world feel a bit more alive.
## WARNING
This mod is strictly considered a beta and is prone to errors - committing to this means that you will experience issues with certain missions such as soft locking, hard locking and potentially corrupt saves.
This mod was tested on a downgraded version of Steam GTA San Andreas with ModLoader.
## Requirements
1. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas v1.0
2. Ultimate ASI Loader by ThirteenAG
